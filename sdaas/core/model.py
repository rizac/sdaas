    Computes the amplitude anomaly scores from the given feature vectors,
    element wise. Returns a numpy array of anomaly scores in [0, 1], where
    the closer a scores is to 1, the more likely it represents an anomaly.
    Note however that in the default scenario (`model` is None or missing, i.e.
    use the pre-trained model), we observed scores are returned in the range
    [0.4, 0.8]: scores <=0.5 can be safely considered inliers (i.e., normal
    observations), and - for binary classification - scores > 0.5 need to be
    inspected to determine the onset of the decision threshold.

    :param features: a numpy array of shape [N, M], where M=1 is the
        single feature denoting the PSD (in decibels) computed at 5 seconds
        (PSD@5s). As M=1, an array of length N (e.g., [1, 0.35, ..]) is also a
        valid argument and will be reshaped internally before classification
        (e.g., [[1], [0.35], ..]).
        *IMPORTANT*: If `model` is None (the default and recommended, meaning
        that the pre-trained and validated model is used), the features should
        have been calculated with the functions of this package (see

    :param model: a :class:`scikit.ensemble.IsolationForest`, or None. If None
        (the default), the pre-trained model evaluated on a general dataset of
        seismic waveforms will be used. See also :func:`create_model`
    :param check_nan: boolean (default: True), checks for NaN in features
        and skip their computation: NaNs (numpy.nan) will be returned for these
        elements. If this parameter is False, `features` must not contain
        NaNs, otherwise an Exception is raised
